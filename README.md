# hello-world
The world is pretty big, I hope the don't all respond at the same time.
I have never had a traditional role as a programmer within my career. I have done light programming since I was a kid. I am trying to get a better grasp on the software develpment cycle within our organization, as we try to move more towards a DevOps structure. Currently we do not know much about DevOps other than it is faster than we our moving today.
Also hoping to try out some moon tacos!
